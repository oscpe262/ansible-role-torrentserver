# list of feed URLs. You can specify one or more feeds, in case of the latter use curly brackets (see the "patterns" option for an example)
# Obsolete. Use "feed" option instead.
#url = ""

# A feed contains at least a feed URL and some optional parameters:
#    "cookie"  =>  If the feed sits behind a login-secured site, you may specify the cookie information here so that Automatic
#                   can download the feed (and any torrents that are matched)
#     "id"      =>  Give a feed a numeric ID which can be used to restrict certain filters to only be used with a specific feed.
#
# Sometimes the download URLs in the RSS feed don't point to the correct download location for the torrent.
# Then a URL rewrite is necessary. You can use the following (optional) parameters to do that:
#     "url_pattern" => Pattern of the URL as found in the RSS feed. Use regular expressions and capture groups
#                      to capture parts of the URL that need to be reused.
#     "url_replace" => The 'new' URL that ought to be used as the actual download link for the torrent.
#                      You can insert the captured groups from 'url_pattern' here.
#  Example:
#    "url_pattern"  =>  "http://www.sometorrentsite.com/rssdownload.php/(.+)$"   # This URL has 1 capture group (the part in parentheses)
#    "url_replace"  =>  "http://www.sometorrentsite.com/download.php?/\1"        # Using '\1' in the URL places that part from the above URL
#                                                                                # at the end of the new URL
